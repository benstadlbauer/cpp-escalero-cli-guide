# Stages

1. Enter dice combination of first round
2. Simulate throws of all subsets of dice for remaining rounds
	1. For each open category record probability of occuring from simulations
	here distinguish between one and two consecutive throws for good throws out of possible throws
	for 2nd throw only cound 2nd throw
	for 3rd throw cound 2nd and 3rd throw

for now just one throw ahead: matrix where row is subset of dice and column is entry for category
